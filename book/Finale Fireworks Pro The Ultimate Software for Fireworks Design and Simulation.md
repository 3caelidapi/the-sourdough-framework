Here are some of the features that make Finale Fireworks Pro stand out from the rest:
 
- **Visual Design:** Finale Fireworks Pro has a real-time simulation and drag-and-drop user interface that allow you to design interactively. You can simply drag an effect's trajectory to change its angle or move it from one position to another. You can also scrub back and forth on the timeline to get a feel for what you've designed. Finale Fireworks Pro generates simulations for your effects automatically from their descriptions. You can get started with the 6,000 generic effects, or the supplier libraries from Lidu and others, or import your own inventory from a CSV, or type in the names of effects on the fly when you need them[^1^].
- **High Quality Simulation:** Finale Fireworks Pro can create stunning Ultra-HD simulation videos for prospective clients in 1080p or 4K. You can effortlessly import any Sketchup models of buildings or venues without any file conversion required. You can also enter the coordinates of the shoot site from Google Maps to project a satellite view on the ground. You can set your own render resolution, frame rate, slow-mo options, lighting and rendering parameters, smoke, wind, and randomness options. You can generate videos and long-exposure images locally on your own computer, no network connection required[^1^].
- **Powerful Rack Layout:** Finale Fireworks Pro is the only software in the world to support visual rack layout for all types of standard and single-shot racks[^3^]. You can use Finale's "Add racks for show" functions or layout the racks yourself by dragging-and-dropping from a palette of predefined or custom racks. Finale Fireworks Pro supports all kinds of custom racks, including single-shot racks with adjustable rows or posts, slide-in tracks, caliber ranges, fixed or variable angles, integrated firing system wiring, and more. The rack functions add the optimal number of racks for the show, choosing from racks in your inventory. From there you can re-arrange the racks into groups. The software takes your arrangements into account for firing system addressing, to avoid inefficient or impossible wiring. If you want to fine tune the wiring, you can make adjustments by simply dragging the pin numbers from rack to rack or module to module[^1^].
- **Customizable Reports:** Finale Fireworks Pro has fully customizable reports and labels. You can choose from 30 preset designs or layout your own reports with control over every detail â column size, order of columns, font size, spacing, pagination, page size (A4/letter), page orientation, headers, titles, what data is displayed, how the data is grouped, and how certain data like firing system addresses and angles are formatted[^1^].
- **Inventory Management:** Finale Fireworks Pro can import inventory from CSV, MDB, or EFX files. Finale Fireworks Pro creates simulations automatically from the descriptions and specifications like prefire, duration, or height. Finale Fireworks Pro includes import, export and simple inventory management features for maintaining quantities. The software also has deep integration with Finale Inventory for full scale inventory management, barcoding, and ATF approved reporting[^1^].
